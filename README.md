# Music Geek Dashboard

Welcome to the 'Music Geek Dashboard' project! This dashboard is designed specifically for DJs, vinyl record collectors, and electronic music enthusiasts.

# Live Deployment

You can access the live deployment of the Music Geek Dashboard [here](https://music-geek-dashboard.vercel.app/).

## Overview

The 'Music Geek Dashboard' comprises three widgets, each serving a unique purpose and fetching data from external APIs:

1. **Weather Widget**: Utilizes data from [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to display current weather information relevant to the user's location.

2. **Discogs Widget**: Retrieves details about a selected vinyl record using the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/).

3. **Mixcloud Widget**: Presents information and user comments about a DJ mix sourced from the [Mixcloud API](https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/), particularly focusing on mixes hosted on Resident Advisor.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- SCSS: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

## Functionality

This project is purely frontend-oriented, with all API fetching and data manipulation handled client-side.

## Purpose

The Music Geek Dashboard was created as part of a job application assignment. It serves as a demonstration of frontend development skills, including API integration and data visualization within the Vue.js ecosystem.
